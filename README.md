# IP Address Tracker

## Overview
This project is an IP Address Tracker web application that allows users to search for any IP address or domain and view its location on an interactive map. The app uses the [GeoIPify API](https://geo.ipify.org/) for geolocation data and [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) for map rendering. It is built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript.

## Features
- Search for an IP address or domain.
- Display IP, location, timezone, and ISP information.
- Interactive map shows the IP location with a custom marker.
- Responsive layout and basic accessibility enhancements.

## Approach
- Fetch IP data from GeoIPify API.
- Dynamically update the page content and map marker.
- Use Bootstrap for layout and styling.
- Add accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, roles, alerts).

## Reflection
This project helped me practice integrating third-party APIs and displaying dynamic data on a map. I improved my understanding of asynchronous JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and responsive layout with Bootstrap. Additionally, adding accessibility features reinforced the importance of designing web applications that are usable for all users.
